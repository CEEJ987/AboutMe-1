        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is Conner Thompson, I was born and raised in Memphis, TN! I'm currently 20 years old, but still have the love for technology.
             As a kid I played video games, and messed with computers consistently. I never started coding until middle school but I wish I started as a kid.
              These experiences shaped who I am today, with my vast knowledge of techonology,
             I want to continue to learn and strive to become a great programmer.</p>
